The obstacle vehicles is a similar robot like the participant's kit with the same car body. So participants
can easily validate their approach at home. The obstacle vehicle is a fixed object on the right lane of road. 
On this part of the road the central line has to be dashed. The robot has to pass the line to left lane for avoiding 
the collision with the other vehicle and must return to right lane before the dashed line's ending.
