Periodic status and examples
=============================

Each selected team has to send an updated project plan, a report and a video in each month on the communicated platform. The deadlines can be seen on our website upload `section`_ .

**All the information and described below are only proposed structures and models. You have to create your own documents in order to prepear the periodic status of your team.
If used as it is, the team may lose points on the evaluation. We highly encourage you to adapt and the models while under development to the actual status of the project.**

We recommend to first make software architecture. The architecture, is usually used in industry in order to have an overview of the project modules and the 
communication between them. This helps parallel development, features addition, debugging and portability of the modules to other projects. By having a strong 
architecture, you can make a project plan with deadlines, efforts, parallelness and dependencies, so that all the team components can work in the same time 
without depending completly on other colleagues/modules and still respecting all the checkpoints of the project.

Periodic reports are usually sent in industry so that the clients always know the status of the requested projects. We all know the saying "an image worth 1000 words", so 
in order to strengthen the view of a client on the developed project, some multimedia documents are needed (for example a video of the new implementations).

Following, you can see some examples of the requested documents.
