3D Printed components
======================

On the robot we use four 3d printed components: Nucleo and Raspberry Pi 4 support, Camera base holder, Camera joint 1, Camera joint 2. 
The 3d models of these components you download from following links:
    
    - `Nucleo and Raspberry Pi 4 suport`_
    - `Camera base`_
    - `Camera joint 1`_
    - `Camera joint 2`_

.. _`Camera joint 2`: https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/BFMC_Main/blob/master/source/3DModels/PicameraHolderPart3.STL


On the race track we place elements that are printed or built. The model for these posts you can download from following links:
    - `Traffic sign base`_
    - `Traffic sign pole`_
    - `Separator block`_
