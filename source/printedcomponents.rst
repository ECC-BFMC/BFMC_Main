3D Printed components
======================

On the new robot we use three 3d printed components: Nucleo and Raspberry Pi 4 support, Camera base holder, Camera joint 1, Camera joint 2. 
The 3d models of these components you download from following links:
    
    - `Nucleo and Raspberry Pi 4`_
    - `Camera base`_
    - `Camera joint 1`_
    - `Camera joint 2`_

On the race track we place some traffic sign, which are fixed a 3D printed posts. The model for these posts you can download from following links:
    - `Base`_
    - `Pole`_
