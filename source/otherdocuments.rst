Monthly report plan
````````````````````

Each selected teams have to send a report and a video in each month. The deadlines will be published on the official event site 
in the `calendar <https://www.boschfuturemobility.com/events/>`_ . The teams have to write a technical report about their progress and 
have to send a demo video. The report template you can download from the following `link <https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/BFMC2020.Main/blob/master/source/templates/Technical_Report.doc>`_. 
We recommend to make a project plan and design simple software architecture, where you can follow the state of progress. This project plan need to
include all features and task, which you want to develop until the challenge. You can send the project plan separately or attached to the report, where 
you can update the current state in each month. `Here <https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/BFMC2020.Main/blob/master/source/templates/ProjectPlan.xlsx>`_ a simple project plan example, where the first sheet presents a time plan and the second sheet can
describe the details of task.
